-  Hi, I’m @SamSpellman. I am attending the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I am a part of the Wisconsin Robotics student organization.
-  I’m interested in robotics, low level programming languages, and alternative energies.
-  I’m currently learning to program in C. I am learning through my Machine Organization and Programming course.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on any project that allows me to get a better grasp on computer science theories. I love learning more about programming, and gaining new skills.
